# <Project Name> – APM Memory Root
**Memory Strategy:** Dynamic-MD
**Project Overview:** [To be filled by Manager Agent before first phase execution]

## Experiment Structure
This repository supports multiple concurrent experiments. Each experiment has its own memory space under `Memory/experiments/<experiment_name>/`.

### Active Experiments
[List of experiments with their memory paths will be maintained here as experiments are created]

### Experiment Memory Paths
- Experiment memory logs are stored in: `Memory/experiments/<experiment_name>/Phase_XX_<slug>/`
- Each experiment maintains isolated memory for phases and tasks
